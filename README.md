# README – Root Cause Analysis of ElecKart’s Revenue Problem

## Project Overview

This project aims to identify the underlying causes behind **ElecKart’s recent revenue decline** despite heavy marketing spending. ElecKart, a leading e-commerce company based in Ontario, Canada, specializes in electronic products and operates under a **marketplace model**, connecting sellers and buyers via its online platform.

The **CFO of ElecKart** has raised concerns about poor turnover and ineffective marketing budgets. As a consultant, the objective is to conduct a **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** using the **5 Whys** or **Issue Tree** framework to uncover operational inefficiencies and recommend actionable improvements.

---

## Objective

* To analyze the **revenue problem** faced by ElecKart.
* To explore all potential contributing factors including **marketing inefficiency, customer churn, website usability issues, seller management, and logistics performance**.
* To create a structured **Issue Tree diagram on Coggle**, identifying the chain of “Why” questions leading to the root causes.

---

## Methodology

### Framework Used

* **Issue Tree Approach (MECE Framework)**

  * The main problem (“Revenue Decline”) is divided into major contributing areas such as:

    1. **Marketing & Promotions**
    2. **Customer Experience**
    3. **Operational Efficiency**
    4. **Product & Seller Management**

* **5 Whys Analysis** applied iteratively under each branch to find actionable root causes.

## Key Hints & Findings

* Despite high marketing expenditure, ROI remained low → indicates **poor marketing mix optimization**.
* High customer churn observed → linked to **poor user experience and lack of mobile app**.
* Website interface confusing with incomplete product details → leading to **conversion drop-offs**.
* Logistic and delivery inefficiencies may have impacted **customer satisfaction and retention**.
* Seller onboarding and quality control inconsistencies may have reduced **product reliability and trust**.

## Deliverables

1. **Coggle Issue Tree Chart (PDF)** – illustrating:

   * The main revenue problem.
   * Sub-branches of potential issues.
   * Successive “Why” layers leading to root causes.
   * Clear identification of primary root causes and improvement areas.

2. **This README file** – explaining context, methodology, and deliverables.

## Tools Used

* **Coggle** – for visual issue tree creation and root cause mapping.
* **PDF Export** – for submission.
* **Business Analysis Frameworks:**

  * 5 Whys
  * Issue Tree (MECE principle)
  * Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

## Outcome

The RCA highlights that ElecKart’s **revenue decline** was primarily driven by:

* **Ineffective marketing spend allocation**
* **Poor digital customer experience**
* **Weak seller quality and assortment strategy**

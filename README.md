\# README – Root Cause Analysis of ElecKart’s Revenue Problem



\## Project Overview



This project aims to identify the underlying causes behind \*\*ElecKart’s recent revenue decline\*\* despite heavy marketing spending. ElecKart, a leading e-commerce company based in Ontario, Canada, specializes in electronic products and operates under a \*\*marketplace model\*\*, connecting sellers and buyers via its online platform.



The \*\*CFO of ElecKart\*\* has raised concerns about poor turnover and ineffective marketing budgets. As a consultant, the objective is to conduct a \*\*Root Cause Analysis (RCA)\*\* using the \*\*5 Whys\*\* or \*\*Issue Tree\*\* framework to uncover operational inefficiencies and recommend actionable improvements.

\## Objective



\* To analyze the \*\*revenue problem\*\* faced by ElecKart.

\* To explore all potential contributing factors including \*\*marketing inefficiency, customer churn, website usability issues, seller management, and logistics performance\*\*.

\* To create a structured \*\*Issue Tree diagram on Coggle\*\*, identifying the chain of “Why” questions leading to the root causes.

\## Methodology



\### Framework Used



\* \*\*Issue Tree Approach (MECE Framework)\*\*



&nbsp; \* The main problem (“Revenue Decline”) is divided into major contributing areas such as:



&nbsp;   1. \*\*Marketing \& Promotions\*\*

&nbsp;   2. \*\*Customer Experience\*\*

&nbsp;   3. \*\*Operational Efficiency\*\*

&nbsp;   4. \*\*Product \& Seller Management\*\*



\* \*\*5 Whys Analysis\*\* applied iteratively under each branch to find actionable root causes.

\## Key Hints \& Findings



\* Despite high marketing expenditure, ROI remained low → indicates \*\*poor marketing mix optimization\*\*.

\* High customer churn observed → linked to \*\*poor user experience and lack of mobile app\*\*.

\* Website interface confusing with incomplete product details → leading to \*\*conversion drop-offs\*\*.

\* Logistic and delivery inefficiencies may have impacted \*\*customer satisfaction and retention\*\*.

\* Seller onboarding and quality control inconsistencies may have reduced \*\*product reliability and trust\*\*.
